# Technology Trend Analysis - Capstone Project


In this project, I apply various Data Analytics skills and techniques that I learned as part of the previous courses in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. I assume the role of an Associate Data Analyst who has recently joined the organization and be presented with a business challenge that requires data analysis to be performed on real-world datasets. 

I undertake the tasks of collecting data from multiple sources, performing exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and preparation, statistical analysis and mining the data, creating charts and plots to visualize data, and building an interactive dashboard. The project will culminate with a presentation of MY data analysis report, with an executive summary for the various stakeholders in the organization.

This project is a great opportunity to showcase my Data Analytics skills, and demonstrate my proficiency.

Skills gained from this project:
Microsoft Excel,
Data Analysis,
SQL and RDBMS,
Data Visualization(DataViz), and
Dashboard.
